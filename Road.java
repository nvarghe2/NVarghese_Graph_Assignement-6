/*
 * CLASS : CMSC204
 * ASSIGNMENT 6
 * DESCRIPTION : class Road that can represent the edges of a Graph of Towns.  
 * 				 The class must implement Comparable.  The class stores references 
 * 				 to the two vertices(Town endpoints), the distance between vertices, 
 * 				 and a name, and the traditional methods (constructors, getters/setters, toString, etc.)
 * INSTRUCTOR : Dr.Kuijt
 *  I pledge that I have completed the programming assignment independently.
 *  I have not copied the code from a student or any source.
 * STUDENT : NIKITTA JOAN VARGHESE
